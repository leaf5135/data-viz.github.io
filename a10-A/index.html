    <h4>Reason why it's a bad chart: The chart is confusing because it's a pie chart with lots of colors, making it hard to understand. The labels are all <br>bunched up and overlap each other, so it's tough for viewers to figure out what's going on. Also, the legend blocks part of the chart, making it even <br>more unclear. Plus, the data isn't even from a reliable source; it's just linked to a dictionary page. And to top it off, the title doesn't give any <br>useful information about the data.</h4>

    <h4>Reason why this chart is much better and clear: This sequential paired bar chart is a clear and effective way to represent data compared to a pie <br>chart. By displaying imports and exports of goods side by side, organized by type and year with a dropdown menu, it enhances comprehension. The use of <br>a sequential color scale aids understanding of data size, even without directly comparing bar heights. It adheres to principles like data <br>transformation and Gestalt principles, ensuring clarity. Annotations highlight the key detail of the chart, and the source is prominently cited below, adding credibility.</h4>
